So, you've heard of DogeCode but don't know how to use it? Well this is the **perfect, official** guide for you.


# Chapter 1: Creating a .dogecode file.
Creating a file is fairly easy, isn't it? Go to a text editor (such as notepad, word, wordpad etc) and start coding! Wait, silly me! You don't know how to code!


# Chapter 2: Coding with DogeCode.
Can you type? If you can, good. Because you need to type. Type. And type. So, start off by saying hello!

Input:
`print ("Hello user!")`

Output:
Hello user!

-----------

Does it look simple? If not, it is. Type what it says below the Input label above. Now, save your file as **hello.dogecode**. But when you normally save a file from a text editor, it would automaticlly save as **.txt**. Make sure you **do not** save it as a .txt, and save it as **.dogecode**. Correct save name: **hello.dogecode**. Incorrect save name: **hello.txt**.
